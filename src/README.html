	<p>The PROtotype-based SErvice COmposition (PROSECO) Framework is a
		free and open-source Java tool for automated service composition.
		PROSECO uses prototypes as basis of the services, and builds up on
		these prototypes by gathering user input. Services could be any type
		of server application. Current examples are automated machine learning
		and cloud gaming.</p>

	<h4 id="prototype-selection">Prototype Selection:</h4>
	<p>
		In the Prototype Selection phase, user provides an input (currently as
		keywords i.e.
		<code>&quot;imageclassification&quot;</code>
		,
		<code>&quot;automl&quot;</code>
		,
		<code>&quot;game&quot;</code>
		) and the suitable prototype for the input is selected.
	</p>
	<h4 id="prototype-interview">Prototype Interview:</h4>
	<p>In the interview phase, further questions are asked to the user
		to gather necessary parameters for the prototype. For example, which
		game does the user want to play? or uploading training files for a
		machine learning service.</p>
	<h4 id="finding-best-solution">Finding Best Solution:</h4>
	<p>In this phase, the best solution for users requirements are
		found. For example, for automated machine learning service, best
		possible machine learning pipeline that suits the uploaded training
		file is the best solution.</p>
	<h4 id="run-and-present-solution-as-a-service">Run and Present
		Solution as a Service:</h4>
	<p>Finally, an access point to the best solution is presented to
		the user. An access point can be a game client for cloud gaming
		service or a web application that the user can use for machine
		learning.</p>

	<h2 id="introduction-and-usage">Introduction and Usage</h2>
	<p>
		PROSECO creates executable services based on <em>prototypes</em>. The
		prototypes are the folders within the &quot;prototypes&quot;
		directory, which should contain &quot;almost&quot;-runnable software
		packages. A prototype folder basically consists of (i) a folder
		&quot;src&quot; containing the actual software package and (ii)
		control files that determine how the grounding of that particular
		prototype works; a detailed description of the requirements is given
		below.
	</p>
	<p>You run the PROSECO algorithm with a task keyword, e.g.,
		&quot;gender recognition&quot;, and a set of data in a format
		appropriate for the task (usually a .zip file). Given these two
		inputs, PROSECO identifies the prototype that matches the keyword
		best. Ggenerally, PROSECO supports an ontological matching, but
		currently only an exact match is implemented; hence, there must be a
		folder in the &quot;prototypes&quot; directory that corresponds to the
		query keyword. PROSECO then executes the search algorithms in the
		&quot;strategies&quot; sub-directory, selects the best solution, and
		deploys the final service composition in a new sub-directory within
		your current working directory (from where you call PROSECO).</p>
	<p>
		An exemplary prototype that comes with PROSECO by default is in the
		context of On-The-Fly Machine Learning (OTF-ML). OTF-ML aims at
		providing machine learning functionality to non-expert end-users. The
		concrete problem addressed is the one of gender recognition. The
		requested service is a machine learning algorithm, a classifier, that
		decides whether the person on a given picture (given as .jpeg or .png)
		is male or female. Different from AutoML approaches (e.g., AutoWEKA
		AutoSKLearn), PROSECO understands ML algorithms as services. In this
		sense, ML libraries represent repositories of such services. Using <a
			href="https://sfb901.uni-paderborn.de">On-The-Fly Computing</a>
		paradigms, the computations for algorithm selection and configuration
		are meant to be executed in the cloud by some OTF-ML provider. Since
		the computations for selection and configuration might be very
		demanding for CPU and memory, AutoML approaches are heavily limited by
		the hardware specifications of the user. In contrast to this strong
		limitation, OTF-ML benefits from the rich hardware resources of
		compute centers enabling to leverage parallelization in order to speed
		up the overall process.

	<h2 id="setup-of-a-prototype-folder">Setup of a Prototype Folder</h2>
	<p>Every prototype must contain (we are working on a more flexible
		cersion to also support non-windows systems):
	<ul>
		<li>a file &quot;groundingroutine.bat&quot; replaces the
			placeholders of the prototype by concrete values and builds the
			package</li>
		<li>a file &quot;initconfiguration.bat&quot; bootstraps the ready
			software package for productive usage (if necessary)</li>
		<li>a folder &quot;strategies&quot; containing the search
			strategies (sub-folders) to derive concrete compositions. Each
			search-strategy folder must contain a file run.bat that is used by
			PROSECO to launch a strategy</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2 id="starting-the-server">Starting The Server</h2>
	<p>A web server is contained withing PROSECO to provide an
		interface to the user. A Prototype-specific interview is presented via
		this web server to get necessary inputs of the prototype from the
		user.
	<ul>
		<li>Run <code>de.upb.crc901.proseco.view.app.Application</code>
			as java application to start up the server
		</li>
		<li>You can then access the web application via <code>http://localhost:8080/init</code>
		</li>
		<li>Fill the input with <code>ic</code> for imageclassification
			prototype or <code>automl</code> for AutoML prototype
		</li>
		<li>You will be presented with the interview of selected
			prototype, fill the necessary inputs of the interview</li>
		<li>At the end of the interview, best solution will be presented
			as result</li>
	</ul>
